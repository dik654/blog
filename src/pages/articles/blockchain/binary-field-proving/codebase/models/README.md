# Binius Models

Binius Models is a collection of Python models of cryptographic algorithms and protocols. They are intended for purposes of readability and communication rather than high-performance.

For now, the goal is to present a minimal implementation of FRI-Binius, a multilinear polynomial commitment scheme over binary tower fields, developed in [[DP24](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/504.pdf)]. Also included is an implementation of the Vision Mark-32 hash function, as developed in [[AMPŠ24](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/633)].

## Dependencies

This project uses

- [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to manage Python versions. [Installation](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation).
- [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage the Python environment and dependencies. [Installation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).
- [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to automatically deal with simple code issues (e.g., formatting and static analysis). [Installation](https://pre-commit.com/#install).
- [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/) to validate Python implementations against.

### SageMath

SageMath is a popular open-source language for math, based on Python.
We use Sage to generate data for tests, specifically `vision`. However, Sage is not required to run any of the tests.

We require Sage version 10, which unfortunately is not currently distributed by standard Linux package managers like `apt` on Ubuntu.
The recommended workaround is to run Sage in a Docker container using the standard [`sagemath/sagemath`](https://hub.docker.com/r/sagemath/sagemath) Docker image.

In this case, [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and test it with the following:

```bash
$ docker run --rm sagemath/sagemath sage --version
SageMath version 10.0, Release Date: 2023-05-20
```

Then set the environment variable `export SAGE_IN_DOCKER=1` before running tests.

## Development

With pyenv correctly installed and configured, install the currently used version of Python:

```bash
$ pyenv install  # this will install Python 3.12 (set in ./.python-version)
```

Check that the `pyenv` local version is correct:

```bash
$ pyenv version
3.12.9 (set by <CWD>/.python-version)
```

Set up the poetry environment using `pyenv`:

```bash
$ poetry env use $(pyenv which python)
```

Install dependencies with

```bash
$ poetry install
```

Run the type checker with

```bash
$ poetry run mypy
```

Run tests with

```bash
$ poetry run pytest -m "not slow"
```

Install and configure pre-commit

`pre-commit` can be installed locally with:
```
pip install pre-commit
```

The `pre-commit` hooks are configured in the file `.pre-commit-config.yaml` at the root directory. The hooks can be installed with the following command.

```
pre-commit install
```

The `pre-commit` hooks, once installed, will be triggered automatically when commit is made. However, it is possible to run it manually with the following command.
```
pre-commit run --all-files
```

To update hooks from time to time run
```
pre-commit autoupdate
```
